Description: A list of methods for estimating a smooth tensor with an unknown permutation. It also contains several multi-variate functions for generating permuted signal tensors and corresponding observed tensors. For a detailed introduction for the model and estimation techniques, see the paper by Chanwoo Lee and Miaoyan Wang (2021) "Smooth tensor estimation with unknown permutations" <arXiv:2105.01783>.
